I am software developer by profession.

Area of Interest : Computational Geometry, Computer Graphics, GPGPU, Computer Vision, Machine Learning

Over past few years I have worked on various computational geometry and graphics algorithms. Very soon in my journey of working on these algorithms, I ran into the foundational problem of robust geometric predicates. This kind of derailed (well, just delayed) my ambition of working on any serious projects implementing geometric algorithms, as you cannot hope to achieve anything in geometry without understanding robust predicates first.
I then spent couple of years trying to peel the layers of how the predicates are dealt with. I came across expansions, arithmetic filters, and simulation of simplicity - the tricks that I think are the savior of the whole field of computational geometry.

While working on implementing my own version of robust predicates is a task too ambitious and probably not of immediate interest to me, I wanted to implement some algorithm using someone else's implementation of these robust predicates. The 'geogram' library by Bruno Levy provided such a module, and I made use of it to impelement a naive algorithm for Ucnostrained Delaunay Tetrahedralization which I just finished in October 2024.

Towards the graphics side, I had earlier worked with OpenGL, but have recently familiarized myself with Vulkan API and data structures. I plan to continue my education on Vulkan.

As of now I am spending my time dabbling with more algorithms in computational geometry and graphics. I also have some interest in computational methods for PDE's, especially on meshes, though I have not really worked with them ever.

No one's untouched by Machine Learning these days and architectures like Diffusion Net and MeshGraphNets are of my interest here.
